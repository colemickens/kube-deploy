Things:

1. Hardcodes assumptions about ubuntu+systemd
2. terraform is flaky around the subnet
3. terraform is flaky around kubelet.tar sometimes
4. kubelet.service is very flaky and hang irrepairably hang nodes
5. phases are fairly tightly coupled

Other things:

1. This copies root ca private key to the nodes which is not needed

2. I don't see `config.phase2.extra-api-sans` being used anywhere...
